PROJECT: Parsing Syslogs and Generating Reports with Python (A Git Experience)

As part of Coursera's "IT Automation with Python" certification sponsored
by Google, I will be using these files from a previous lesson to practice
using Git and GitHub. These files are a functional demonstration of how to:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Parse a sample log file (syslog.txt) using regex  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Catalog metadata about errors and usage stats into dictionaries  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Organize and export dictionaries to .CSV files  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Test the integrity of a Python script  

Ultimately, the content of this project does not matter, as these files
will only be used to practice concepts related to Git and GitHub.
Nevertheless, here are the project's components:

SYSLOG.TXT  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- My own sample log file, following the Coursera example's format

RESEARCH.PY  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The primary script, which performs the first three functions above

TEST_RESEARCH.PY  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The test script, which contains about a dozen tests (mostly unit)
